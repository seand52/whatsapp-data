# Whatsapp Data Visualizer

You can view a live demo here: https://bright-process.surge.sh/#/


This web app lets you upload your whatsapp chat history and parses the information to display it in different graphs. 

This application is built entirely on the client side, so nothing is stored in a server/database, which means that **no data is collected** since everything is destroyed when you close your session.

Here are a few screenshots of the visualizations:
